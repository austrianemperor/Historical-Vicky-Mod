This is a personal project to combine the modern HPM version's updated mechanics with HFM's flavor. Eventually, I may add in a few mechanics from DBZ especially techs for rebels and bonuses for researching all techs on the same row in a category. I also plan on removing some of the railroading which may impact flavor a bit but gives players far greater agency.
